# Extensive form games
#
# The games are represented by using the classes Terminal, Move, ChanceMove.
#   Terminal(R):   A terminal node of a game, containing a payoff vector R
#   Move(P,S):     Move by agent P, with S containing all sub-games as a list.
#                      List elements are (A,N) where
#                         A is an action name (a string)
#                         N is the sub-game entered by choosing action A
#   ChanceMove(S): Random chance move, with S containing sub-games as a list.
#                      List elements are (P,A,N) where
#                         P is the probability of the subgame N
#                         A is the name of the chance move
#                         N is the subgame entered by choosing action A
#
# All these classes have the following methods:
#   eval(S,P) to evaluate strategy profile S with P as the path to the subgame.
#       S is a list with S[i] giving the strategy for player i
#          A strategy is a dictionary D with D[path] assigning an action to the sub-game
#             at the node reached by the action sequence 'path'.
#   decNodes(path) to list all nodes in which a player can take an action.
#       'path' is the sequence of action/move names on the path to the node.
#       It returns a list of triples (path,player,actions) where
#           path     is the list of action names that lead to the node
#           player   is the index of the player (0,1,...)
#           actions  is the list of action names available in that node
