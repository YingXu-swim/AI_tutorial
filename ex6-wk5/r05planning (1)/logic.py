# Representation of propositional formulas in Python.
#
# The basic connectives are NOT, AND and OR.
# IMPL and EQVI are reduced to these through the obvious reductions.
# We have a separate class for formulas with different outermost
# connectives, as well as for atomic formulas (ATOM).
#
# The method 'map' constructs a new copy of a formula with
# the name N of every atomic formula replaced by f(N).

# Both AND and OR will inherit __init__ from NaryFormula
# NaryFormula means formulas with multiple subformulas.
# conjunction (AND) and disjunction (OR) are traditionally defined
# as binary connectives, that is, with two subformulas.
# Because of associativity, ie. A & (B & C) and (A & B) & C are equivalent,
# it is often more convenient to write A & B & C.
